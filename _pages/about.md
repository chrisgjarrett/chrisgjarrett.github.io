Welcome to my portfolio page. I originally trained as a mechatronics engineer at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. I went on to complete a Masters and PhD focusing on developing control systems for rehabilitation robotics. 

I worked at a couple of medtech startups and gained experience in wearable technologies, data and real-time algorithms. Throughout those years I realised that the world of data fascinated me. I loved the idea of using data to provide insights, creating beautiful visualisations and leveraging the power of AI and ML. I set out to apply for jobs...and didn't get far.
