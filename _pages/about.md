Welcome to my portfolio page. I originally trained as a mechatronics engineer at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. I went on to complete a Masters and PhD focusing on developing control systems for rehabilitation robotics. 

I worked at a couple of medtech startups and gained experience in wearable technologies, data and real-time algorithms. Throughout those years I realised that the world of data fascinated me. I loved the idea of using data to provide insights, creating beautiful visualisations and leveraging the power of AI and ML. In what could best be described as a third-life crisis, I quit my job, travelled to Canada and started to apply to new jobs...and didn't get far. I realised I needed to upskill.

Which brings me here. This website is a culmination and presentation of the skills I have endeavoured to learn on this journey into data. Over the past few months, I've set out to learn new skills and technologies and apply them to projects, building up a portfolio in the hopes of landing a job in data.
